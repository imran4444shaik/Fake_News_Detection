# Fake_News_Detection

The fake news detection project aims to develop a system that can automatically classify news articles as either "fake" or "true." Here's a brief description of the project:

Data Collection:
The project begins with the collection of a dataset containing news articles labeled as either fake or true. These articles may be sourced from various sources or datasets available online.

Data Preprocessing:
The collected dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data for analysis. This may involve tasks such as removing special characters, stopwords, URLs, and HTML tags, as well as converting text to lowercase and handling missing values.

Feature Engineering:
Text data is converted into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models. Common techniques include TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, word embeddings, or other natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Model Training:
Machine learning models, such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks, are trained on the preprocessed and feature-engineered data to learn patterns and characteristics of fake and true news articles.

Model Evaluation:
The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate testing dataset. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the models in correctly classifying fake and true news articles.
